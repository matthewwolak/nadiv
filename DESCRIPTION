Description: Constructs (non)additive genetic relationship matrices, and their
    inverses, from a pedigree to be used in linear mixed effect models (A.K.A.
    the 'animal model'). Also includes other functions to facilitate the use of
    animal models. Some functions have been created to be used in conjunction
    with the R package 'asreml' for the 'ASReml' software, which can be
    obtained upon purchase from 'VSN' international 
    (<http://www.vsni.co.uk/software/asreml>).
