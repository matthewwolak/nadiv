#' 
#' Constructs (non)additive genetic relationship matrices, and their inverses,
#' from a pedigree to be used in linear mixed effect models (A.K.A. the 'animal
#' model'). Also includes other functions to facilitate the use of animal
#' models. Some functions have been created to be used in conjunction with the
#' R package for 'ASReml' software, which can be obtained upon purchase from
