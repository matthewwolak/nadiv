\title{Simulated design random effects}
\usage{
drfx(G, fac, dataf, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{G}{The variance-covariance matrix to model the effects after}

\item{fac}{A character indicating the factor in \code{dataf} with which to
construct the design matrix}

\item{dataf}{A dataframe with \code{fac} in it}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to the internal use of \code{\link{grfx}}}
}
\value{
\item{fx }{A matrix with 'd' columns of random effects} \item{Z }{A
design matrix (of the format 'Matrix') from which the random effects in
  \code{fx} were assigned }
}
\description{
This function simulates effects for random terms in a linear mixed model
based on design matrices. The intended purpose is for simulating
environmental effects from a pedigree.
}
\details{
If G = x, where 'x' is a single number, then 'x' should still be specified
as a 1-by-1 matrix (e.g., \code{matrix(x)}).  Note, the G-matrix should
never have a structure which produces a correlation exactly equal to 1 or
-1.  Instead, covariances should be specified so as to create a correlation
of slightly less than (greater than) 1 (-1).  For example: 0.9999 or
-0.9999.
}
\examples{

# Create maternal common environment effects for 2 traits
# with perfectly correlated effects
  Gmat <- matrix(c(10, 7.071, 7.071, 5), 2, 2)
  cfx <- drfx(G = Gmat, fac = "Dam", dataf = warcolak[1:200, ])
