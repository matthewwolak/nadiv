\title{Approximate standard errors for linear functions of variance components}
\usage{
pin(object, transform)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A list with at least the following elements: \code{gammas},
\code{gammas.type}, and \code{ai} from a REML mixed model}

\item{transform}{A formula specifying the linear transformation of variance
components to conduct}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with row names corresponding to the operator on 
  the left hand side of the \code{transform} formula and the entries 
  corresponding to the \code{Estimate} and approximate \code{SE} of the 
  linear transformation.
}
\description{
This function is similar to the pin calculations performed by the standalone
ASReml.  This function, written by Ian White, applies the delta method for
the estimation of approximate standard errors on linear functions of
variance components from a REML mixed model
}
\details{
Object is intended to be an asreml-R model output.

The formula can use \code{V1,..., Vn} to specify any one of the \code{n}
variance components.  These should be in the same order as they are in the
object (e.g., see the row order of \code{summary(object)$varcomp} for
asreml-R models.
}
\examples{

# Below is the heritability calculation for tait1 of the warcolak dataset
# Re-create the output from a basic, univariate animal model in asreml-R
   asrMod <- list(gammas = c(0.6383285, 1.00),
	gammas.type = c(2, 1),
	ai = c(0.0044461106, -0.0011754947, 0.0004424668))
   namevec <- c("ped(ID)!ped", "R!variance")
   names(asrMod[[1]]) <- names(asrMod[[2]]) <- namevec

   nadiv:::pin(asrMod, h2 ~ V1 / (V1 + V2))
